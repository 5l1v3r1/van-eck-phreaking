# van-eck-eavesdropping

As part of the work in the White-Hats PWr scientific circle I took up the topic of the so-called Van Eck's Phreaking.
This phenomenon is present in CRT monitors. Thanks to it, with the help of a good antenna, you can receive a signal containing a picture from such a monitor from a few to tens of meters. This is a direct threat to security and privacy, which was present at times when CRT monitors were widely used.More info:

To make research about this phenomena, tests has been carried out using an old CRT monitor, which was taken place at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. The monitor was placed in a anechoic chamber in order to take samples of signal received by sensitive antenna. There was couple of pictures which was set fullscreen (test black and white checkerboards and sample text). After setting screen, samples of signals captured by antenna has been probed.

Signal length was 2/60 s (2 frames length, monitor's frequency refresh was 60Hz).

Result images after signal processing are in folder "wyniki".
